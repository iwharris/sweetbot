# :candy: sweetbot

### Description
A Slack bot to do scrums in 140 characters or less. A #hackday2016 project at [AppCarousel](www.appcarousel.com)!

### Investor pitch

Our daily scrums tend to run for longer than they should, consuming many developer hours every day. When we should just be giving a high-level view of our current tasks, we often get bogged down in JIRA ticket numbers, deployment strategies, and Ian's choice of t-shirt.

"But what can I do about it?", you ask.

Introducing  SweetBot! (scrum tweet bot! short and sweet bot!) Using one weird old trick, it allows team leads to organize daily standups on Slack. First, everyone sends their scrum(ptious) update to SweetBot in less than 140 characters (excessively verbose updates are not accepted). At the scheduled scrum time, everyone's update is posted to the team channel in a concise list.

- It's searchable, easy to read, and completely asynchronous!
- It will disrupt your industry!
- It will optimize your KPIs!
- It will leverage your team's synergies to deliver innovative value, increasing your ROI!
